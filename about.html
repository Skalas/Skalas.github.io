<p> I am currently developing the infrastructure and analysis for Big Data at OPI: Open Intelligence. I hold an Applied Mathematics degree from the ITAM, and I am completing a Masters in Data Science at the same university. </p>

  I have worked in security and intelligence, optimizing and generating an automated strategy to improve the state of crime in Mexico City, using video-monitoring techniques with the city's police force. This work won a competition for the best practices in crime analysis in Latin America by the Paz Ciudadana Foundation. Our work was subsequently published and acted upon.

I specialise in database management, machine learning, big data infrastructure design, data analysis statistics, optimization, numerical calculus, and differential equations.
