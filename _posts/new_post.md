When I started working with Linux, specifically Ubuntu, it was a frightening experience. First of all everything was kind of different, 

I had no clue to what was happening. When something failed I would just look in the internet, copy-paste all the commands that gave me the promise, of a solution.

I don't have to tell you how many times I screwed my system up. Everytime I had to look up all of the instalation procedures for the software I needed, it took hours to get my computer working again.
