Over the last couple of years one of the tools that has gained  huge popularity and momentum is Docker, which in their own words is:

>Docker is an open platform for building, shipping and running distributed applications. It gives programmers, development teams and operations engineers the common toolbox they need to take advantage of the distributed and networked nature of modern applications.

About the technical details of what is Docker you can see [here](https://docs.docker.com/introduction/understanding-docker/), [here](http://devopscube.com/what-is-docker/) or [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16047306/how-is-docker-different-from-a-normal-virtual-machine). In short, docker is a way of running a _lightweight virtual machine_ on your own computer, each Docker image contains a full Operating System in them.
